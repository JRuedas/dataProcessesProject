## Abstract

## Introduction and related work

Nowadays, pollution levels in Madrid is a popular topic in the [news](https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/11/29/inenglish/1575050927_871123.html). This has worried some of the group members who are thinking about moving to Madrid because they live in the outskirts. That is we want to know which area of Madrid is the most suitable for us to buy an apartment.

We have found some related works that works with the same data:

[Madrid Air Quality Exhaustive Tutorial on Stationarity, Smoothing, and Seasonality](https://www.kaggle.com/nholloway/stationarity-smoothing-and-seasonality). This projects is an introduction to time series while using Madrid's pollution datasets.

[Explore air quality in Madrid](https://www.kaggle.com/dgildas/explore-air-quality-in-madrid). It wants to explore these datasets because of the measures taken by the authorities against the use of cars in the center of Madrid.

[Madrid's pollution weekly mean values](https://www.kaggle.com/fjortag/interactive-plot-showing-weekly-mean-values). You can see an interactive chart about the levels of pollution depending on the year that you want to see.

[Airquality analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/qgh1223/airquality-analysis). It is a project where it is plotted information about the most important pollutants of the datasets.

[Madrid's Air Quality with ARIMA Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/gloriousc/madrid-s-air-quality-with-arima-forecasting). Worried about the short term and long term effects on health, the creator of this project want to analyze the air quality and predict it in for the next two years.

## Exploratory data analysis

### Dataset description

Before exposing the findings during the exploratory data analysis, important information and background about the dataset is introduced below:

The dataset used for this work was obtained from [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/ "Kaggle's website"). In this page, we can find a lot of information and datasets about the air quality in Madrid.

Our data is composed by **18 data sets** that contain observations of the level of presence of **various gases** in Madrid's air, **which can be noxious for human health**, during the last 18 years (from 2001 to 2018). This information is recorded by 24 different stations, each one located in a different area of the city, that measure the level of presence of each pollutant through several sensors. There is data about the presence of each gas during each hour of the day, every day of every month. 

The data in this data set has been collected from the original files provided by [Madrid Open Data.](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=9e42c176313eb410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default) Decide soluciones organization processed them and uploaded to the [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/decide-soluciones/air-quality-madrid).

Regarding the **observations**, all csv files include data for every month, except the last one (2018) that only has records until  May. According to this, we have the following number of rows for each data set (note that the stations.csv stores information about the 24 stations through which the information about the pollutants was measured):

| CSV | Observations |
| --- | ------------ |
| Stations.csv | 24 rows |
| Madrid2001.csv | 217872 rows |
| Madrid2002.csv | 217296 rows |
| Madrid2003.csv | 243984 rows |
| Madrid2004.csv | 245496 rows |
| Madrid2005.csv | 237000 rows |
| Madrid2006.csv | 230568 rows |
| Madrid2007.csv | 225120 rows |
| Madrid2008.csv | 226392 rows |
| Madrid2009.csv | 215688 rows |
| Madrid2010.csv | 209448 rows |
| Madrid2011.csv | 209928 rows |
| Madrid2012.csv | 210720 rows |
| Madrid2013.csv | 209880 rows |
| Madrid2014.csv | 210024 rows |
| Madrid2015.csv | 210096 rows |
| Madrid2016.csv | 209496 rows |
| Madrid2017.csv | 210120 rows |
| Madrid2018.csv | 69096 rows |

We can also differentiate two domains whose columns represent different data:

On the one hand, as it was mentioned above, we have the Stations.csv with six columns, which contain information about the stations:

* **id**: unique identifier for each station.
* **address**: location of the station in Madrid city.
* **Three additional columns** that stand for the exact location coordinates of the station.

On the other hand, we have the data sets named Madrid20xx.csv, which contain the observations about Madrid's air pollution itself. Some of these csv files have 14 columns, others 16 and others 17. These columns include information about the level of presence of each pollutant in Madrid's air, the station that measured the information, and the date (year, month, day, hour, minute and second) in which this information was obtained by the station.

We have the following number columns in the csv files:

| CSV | Features |
| --- | -------- |
| Stations.csv | 6 columns |
| Madrid2001.csv | 16 columns |
| Madrid2002.csv | 16 columns |
| Madrid2003.csv | 16 columns |
| Madrid2004.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2005.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2006.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2007.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2008.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2009.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2010.csv | 17 columns |
| Madrid2011.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2012.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2013.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2014.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2015.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2016.csv | 14 columns |
| Madrid2017.csv | 16 columns |
| Madrid2018.csv | 16 columns |

### Data wrangling
Before getting to work with the previously described data, some steps were performed in order to make the data more manageable:

#### Selected Features

As it was mentioned before, the data sets that record information about pollution in Madrid's air provide data about several gases that can be harmful for human health. To carry on the upcoming analysis, we are concerned about the most harmful ones: [CO](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/carbon-monoxides-impact-indoor-air-quality), [O3](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/health-effects-ozone-pollution), [SO2](https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics#what%20is%20so2), [PM10](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm) and [NO2](https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/basic-information-about-no2).

As all these links recall, all of these 5 pollutants can cause different types of pain in humans, such as chest pain, and can hurt vital organs, like lungs. Some of them are responsible for environmental phenomenons like acid rain, that can harm sensitive ecosystems very easily, or haze (also known as reduced visibility). Some of them also contribute to contaminate lakes and other big water resources, changing their acidity.

After these insights, it is clear that when choosing a new place to live, it is very convenient to take a look at what environmental factors can harm our health, and these five pollutants are very important ones. Therefore in our upcoming analysis we will be focusing specifically on the behavior of these pollutants.

#### Datasets unification

In order to work with the data, all the yearly datasets were unified in a single one, adding one additional feature to the existing date column that all of the datasets present: the year. Thus, after this transformation, a single dataset contained all the information about Madrid's air pollution in the last 17 years, instead of 17 different datasets (one per year). Two additional columns were added: the _only_month_  and  _only_year_ columns, wich stand for the month and the year in which the observation was recorded, respectively.

#### Missing values treatment

As we can observe in the plot below, there is a **high amount of missing values** in the variables that we concern about:

``` {r out.width="80%", out.height="80%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/pctg_missing_values.png")
```


Thus, in order to deal with missing values, the **mean of each one of the variables for each year, month and station is computed**, so that all the missing values for each one of the pollutants in that same year, month and station are imputed with the corresponding mean. In case that one station has missing values all the month, they are replaced with the **mean of the column in that same year and month from all the stations**. We have developed a separate script to **regenerate all the csv files following this treatment to erase missing values**, and then employed these treated csvs to perform the rest of the analysis. The ultimate goal of this approach is **to reduce the time it takes to execute this script**: it would be very time consuming to execute it every time we need the data.

### Descriptive statistics analysis

After wrangling our data as it was necessary, we are ready to take a first look at our variables.

To start exploring our data, the distribution of the variables in our dataset in terms of **center, dispersion and distribution descriptive measures**, is analysed below.

We will end this section providing the reader some **insights on the temporal evolution of our data**, what historical patterns can be extracted and how they may relate to other real world phenomena. 

#### Center, dispersion and distribution measures

The plot below is useful to visualize the center measures of the five selected variables:

``` {r out.width="80%", out.height="80%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/box_plots.png")
```

As we can see, variables NO2, O3 and PMH10 spread along wide ranges, while variables SO2 and CO spread along narrower ranges. A characteristic that they all share is that all of them have many outliers or highly unexpected values.

The histograms below show a better insight of the shape of the distribution of the variables: as we can see, all of them are highly skewed to the right, so they don't follow a normal distribution.

``` {r out.width="80%", out.height="80%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/histograms.png")
```

In the plot above, we can also observe a phenomenon that leads us to the conclussion that, depending on what we want to do with the data in upcoming sections, it may be a good approach to normalize it: variables SO2 and CO always take values that are very close to 0, while the other variables can reach much higher values.

### Data insights

It is interesting to answer some questions related to our data, in order to acquire some previous knowledge on how pollution behaves in Madrid's air, taking into account factors like year month and hour in the day, before procceeding to further steps in the project.

It is important to highlight that the questions that we intend to answer in this section are merely exploratory. We are still not trying to predict any phenomenon, but it may be interesting to **find out some patterns in the temporal evolution of the five pollutants**.

At first, it is interesting for us to observe the **yearly evolution of the maximum value that each pollutant reaches each month**. In order to do so, first the maximum value for each day on each month and year is computed. Then, the average value for each month per year is obtained. Note that the values have been normalized to be on the same scale. The resulting plot, looks as follows:

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/yearly_evolution_of_max.png")
```

From the plot above we can see some curious information:

* the clear patterns followed by **O3** and **SO2** are the opposite: while the levels of O3 reach their yearly maximum during the months in the middle of the year (summer months) and decrease towards the end of the year, we observe the opposite trend for SO2, that reaches its yearly minimum values towards the middle of the year, and its maximum towards the end.

* **PM10** levels have reached a more regular trend since year 2014. The trend of this variable is very irregular. This also happens with variable **NO2**, which has an irregular trend aswell, but this variable seems to reach the yearly maximum value towards the end of the year, even though the maximum value can change a lot from one year to another.

* The temporal evolution of variable **CO** is more irregular than the one for SO2 and O3, but a pattern is also appreciated: the yearly maximum value is reached mostly towards the end of the current year and the beginning of the next one, in the coolest months.

To support these findings, we provide the following set of plots:

``` {r out.width="80%", out.height="80%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/O3_daily_monthly.png")
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/PM10_daily_monthly.png")
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/NO2_daily_monthly.png")
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/SO2_daily_monthly.png")
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/CO_daily_monthly.png")
```

For **O3** and **SO2**, the previously observed patterns are maintained: the month of the year in which O3 reaches its maximum level is july, while the month of the year in which it reaches its lowest level is january. SO2 behaves the opposite way: winter months are more prone to have higher levels of this gas than summer months. However, we can find a common trend for both gases: the minimum level of SO2 and O3 that is present in Madrid's air has increased since 2015, which leads to the conclussion that the general level of presence of these two gases seems to be growing.

For **PMH10**, we can see that the daily minimum level of the gas seems to be slightly decreasing, which is good news. The overall trend of the temporal evolution of the level of presence of this pollutant is still irregular, reaching its maximum values in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Since 2014, the stiffness of irregularities has decreased, but the overall trend of PMH10 seems to be stabilizing in a higher level of presence of this gas, unitl january 2018, when it dramatically decreases.

**NO2** follows a similar trend to the one previously described for PMH10: in the last years, the overall level of presence of the gas seems to be increasing, to dramatically decrease in january 2018, and the overall pattern that it follows is more irregular than the one followed by PMH10.

It also seems that the level of **CO** in Madrid's air is slightly increasing since 2015: the trend followed by minimum values is stabilizing towards a higher value than it was before this year. CO follows a more regular pattern than PMH10 and NO2, decreasing every july and increasing towards january, but there seems to be additional factors during the rest of the year that generate some fluctuations in the pattern.

The patterns followed by the most regular pollutants (O3, SO2 and CO) can be intuitively explained by some real world events:

**O3** is rarely emitted by anthropogenic sources: it is, instead, a direct consecuence of some quimical reactions that take place [in the presence of sunlight](http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/pollutants/overview_O3.htm), which explains why O3 levels are so high during the summer months. On the other hand, **SO2** emissions are a direct consecuence of human action: [burning fossil fuels](https://sciencing.com/major-sources-sulfur-dioxide-10011402.html). One fact that could explain the high level of SO2 during winter may be that during these months, there is a higher industrial activity than in summer. **CO** emissions are caused by [high motor-vehicle emissions](https://www.nap.edu/read/10378/chapter/3#25), so the high level of CO during winter could be explained as a consecuence of higher traffic levels in an area like Madrid during winter than during summer. Probably, if we analysed the levels of CO in a turistic place, the level of this gas would be higher in summer than in winter.

## Strength of relationships

As our intention is to make predictions using our data, it is convenient to analyse the linear relationships among the five pollutants, if any. In order to do so, the correlation matrix is represented in the plot below:

``` {r out.width="80%", out.height="80%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/correlation_matrix.png")
```

In the plot, we can observe that the most correlated pair of variables is CO and NO_2, which are positively related with a value of 0.57. They are followed by O3 and NO2, which are negatively correlated with a value of -0.53. 

In order to have an overall insight on whether there are high correlations among the five variables or not, we are going to calculate the determinant of the correlation matrix:

``` {r out.width="20%", out.height="10%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/exploratory_analysis/determinant_r.png")
```

The value obtained is close to 0, but not small enough to conclude the existence of variables that are linearly dependent on others. There are correlations among the variables, but they are not high enough.

This result is coherent, as the variables recorded in our data seem to be the outcome of some other predictors which are not included in our dataset. For instance, a high number of manufacturing plants in the city, or high traffic levels, could be a direct cause of a high level of some of the gases that our five variables stand for, like SO2.

Due to these findings, in upcoming steps of this project we will not be trying to predict any of the five variables as an outcome of the others.

## Prediction
After reading the data, the next thing that is done is the creation of the serial object and its sequential representation. In the figure shown below we can see that there is a presence of seasonality, that is, a periodic behavior of the series is observed caused by factors that are repeated over time. In our case it can be seen that at the beginning of the year the pollution is not very high but as the months go by it increases with its highest peak in summer and then goes back down. This may be due to the fact that temperatures affect pollution or that public transport is used more. Therefore, in the future it would be a possibility of field of study to see what factors affect the different stations to have more or less pollution. On the other hand we could study the seasonality with the graph but in this case it is not clear, in this graph, no upward or downward trend since since we can see how from 2012 to 2014 it increases and yet from 2014 to 2016 it decreases although in smaller quantity than the previous increase, therefore it could not be said with this graph with certainty what its tendency is. Therefore the conclusion we draw with this graph is that we have seasonality.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/EvolutionOfTheOzone.png")
```

After doing this, we decided to perform the ETS predictive model, used for time series. The following figure shows the time series we are studying with its decomposition of the components of the ETS model, trend and seasonality, which were what we tried to study in the previous case. In these graphs we can see more clearly that it has a very clear seasonality since as we see in the graph it grows and decreases depending on the passage of the seasons or the months, and has its highest peak in the middle of the year, which would correspond to the summer month. On the other hand we can also see the trend more clearly, just as we could deduce before, it does not have a linear trend, that is, we have a non-linear trend. This means that we have a changing trend since we do not only have pollution growth or decrease in it. However, if we look closely at the graph, pollution is usually mostly ascending since it has large growths from 2012 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2016, compared to small descending peaks that we find throughout these years, having the largest of all between 2015 and 2016 but being insignificant against rising peaks.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/ParametersOzone.png")
```

When making the ETS model we obtain the following:

ETS(M,N,M)   
Call:  ets(y = train_ts)     
Smoothing parameters:     
alpha = 0.2495      
gamma = 1e-04     
Initial states:     
l = 95.8235      
s = 0.6168 0.7004 0.8541 1.1307 1.3166 1.433            
    1.3101 1.1716 1.0697 0.9337 0.8102 0.6532    
    sigma:  0.0766       
    AIC     AICc      BIC  
    609.0884 617.6598 643.2384
    
These data correspond to the ETS model that has been estimated for our data. Once this data is obtained, we make the plots to see everything graphically.
The following graph shows the prediction you make based on the data we have provided. As you can see, it makes a pretty good prediction since, as you can see in the graph, the red line that represents our predictions has a shape that resembles that of the real data represented in green.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/TrainigVsTesting.png")
```

After making the prediction we have obtained the histogram of the errors produced during the prediction. The graph shows that the residues have a constant variation over time and their distribution tends to be normal, focusing on 0.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/HistogramOfForecasterrors.png")
```

As we can see in the graph, a single significant lag is obtained, which would be lag 0, since, as observed in the graph, the rest of the values are within the range of the bands. That is why although the fas (auto correlation function) does not have 0 quickly since as we can see there are several lags before it takes that value it can be said that it falls within the bands which is considered sufficient. Therefore the graph shows a regular and seasonal lags correlation.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/ACF.png")
```

Finally, the plot of the waste was done to complete the validation of the model. To verify that the model is satisfactory, the residuals should look random. In our case, we could consider it valid since it does not follow any pattern but it has random values and grows and decreases randomly regardless of the season and the values obtained in previous years.

``` {r out.width="100%", out.height="100%" , fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png) 
knitr::include_graphics("reportImages/TimeSeries/Residual.png")
```
